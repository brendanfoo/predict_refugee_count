# Understanding and Predicting Internal Displacement from Global Floods

# Abstract

Our research aims to address critical gaps in current predictive modeling methods for flood-induced displacements amid escalating global climate change. Using a unified dataset from various sources, including the UN Global Internal Displacement Database, our study employs different robust machine learning models such as random forests for classification and support vector machine for regression. Challenges of scattered and unstandardized data are noted, limiting our analysis to ~60% of the countries. Our findings emphasize the need for improved data quality and standardization for more reliable predictive modeling of flood-induced displacement.
